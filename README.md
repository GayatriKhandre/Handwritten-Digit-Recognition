# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset
**Made by Gayatri Pradeep Khandre**  


## Overview
This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using the **MNIST dataset**. The MNIST dataset consists of **70,000 small images** of handwritten digits, labeled from **0 to 9**. The goal is to classify these images using a **logistic regression model**.

## Dataset
- The **MNIST dataset** contains **70,000 grayscale images** (28Ã—28 pixels each).
- Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).
- The dataset is widely used for testing image classification algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**

## Results
- The **logistic regression model** achieves **97.8% accuracy** on the training dataset.
- The model can successfully classify whether a digit is **'2' or not**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **logistic regression** can be used for **handwritten digit classification** using the **MNIST dataset**. Further improvements can be made by using deep learning techniques such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
